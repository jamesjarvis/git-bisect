CO663 Assessment 1 - Git Bisect

Here is the project requirements taken from [the homework outline](https://rgrig.github.io/plad/homework.html)

## Outline

Most software projects reside in a Git repository. One of the more useful Git commands is bisect. The following is an example from its manual page:

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad                 # Current version is bad
git bisect good abc1234        # abc1234 is known to be good
```

The current version has some bug (is bad); version abc1234 does not (is good). The goal is to find the commit that introduced the bug. Git will checkout some version between abc1234 and the current one and then let you figure out if the bug is present. If the bug is present, you should run the following command:

```bash
git bisect bad
```

If the bug is not present, you should run the following command:

```bash
git bisect good
```

After this, Git checks out another version, you inform Git if the version is bad or good, and this process repeats several times. Eventually, Git reports what is the commit that introduced the bug. Now you have a good hint about where in the code you should look. Or, at least, you know who to blame.

Git tries to figure out where the bug was introduced by asking few questions. After all, figuring out if the bug is present or not may be time consuming: at the very least, it involves compiling the whole project. Git-bisect uses a heuristic that works on arbitrary histories, and degenerates to binary search when used on linear histories. Your task is to try to do better.

A Small Example
You will write a program that communicates with a server: your program plays the role of git-bisect, the server plays the role of a human. The communication works over WebSockets, with messages in JSON format. We use WebSockets because, unlike sockets, they have a notion of message; that is, communication is not a stream of bytes, but a stream of messages. We use JSON because it is a widely used standard for representing structured information in a human-readable format, which makes it easy to debug.

Let us consider an example. Immediately after connecting, the client authenticates by sending the following message:

```json
{"User": "rg399" }
```

(There is no password, but submitting solutions on behalf of somebody else will be considered a breach of academic integrity.)

Next, the server replies with a problem instance:

```json
{"Problem":{"name":"pb0","good":"a","bad":"c","dag":[["a",[]],["b",["a"]],["c",["b"]]]}}
```

The dag (directed acyclic graph) lists for each commit its parents:

a has no parent
b has parent a
c has parent b
This is a linear history, because each commit but one has exactly one parent. In general, one can have merge commits, which have multiple parents. Cycles, however, will never be present. The message also tells us that a is good and c is bad. So, the bug could have been introduced by b or c; but, which one?

The client now asks, and the server responds:

```json
{"Question":"b"}
{"Answer":"Good"}
```

And again:

```json
{"Question":"c"}
{"Answer":"Bad"}
```

At this point, the client figured out that the bug was introduced in version c, and communicates its solution to the server:

```json
{"Solution":"c"}
```

The server now continues by either presenting a new problem instance, or by providing raw scores for all the problem instances seen so far. In this example, there is no further problem instance to solve, so the server replies with:

```json
{"Score":{"pb0":2}}
```

If the solution was correct, the raw score is simply the number of questions asked; if the solution was incorrect, the raw score will be the special value null.

Observe that, from the problem instance, we already know that c is bad, so the second question asked by the client is redundant: this problem instance can be solved with just one question!

## RUN LOCALLY

The actual submission was made using websockets, but since that server is probably down by the time you read this, there is a local version to test.

Simply run:

```bash
go run cmd/fromjson/main.go tests/
```

And this should run for a while and eventually output your results.

FYI: this was optimised for multiprocessing, so the more CPU's you chuck at this thing, the better it gets.
